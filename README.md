# Smart-Vision-System-Project
Smart Vision System using YOLOv8 detects and tracks supermarket items in real time. It captures and annotates frames, fetches product details like expiry and defects from a database, and triggers a NodeMCU-controlled servo to remove faulty items. This AI-driven setup ensures fast, automated, and accurate inventory management.
